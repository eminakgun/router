## TODO

- [ ] Verilate register dut, use FuseSoC core files to verilate
- [ ] Create top level testbench in SystemC which instantiates the verilated DUT
- [ ] Include APB agent and compile top level testbench, i.e run a APB sequence
- [ ] Generate RAL for SystemC, use PeakRDL generated SV-UVM code to translate to UVM-SC
- [ ] Write first sequence to program the DUT and observe DUT outputs!
